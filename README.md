# Flash_Cards
Flash Card application that  allows the cards to be updated via a CSV file.  The answers must be web addresses.

This version only allows the answers to be webaddresses, as I found that the subject I was studying for had a great online help reference section.

Overview:

Option 1: " Practice with Cards" is a standard way of viewing flash cards.  You get a single item of a given subject, you then view the definition within an 
specified online resource.  You also have the option to 'skip' a card when viewing the item before the definition page.  This way, if it's an item that
is already known, you can go on until you get to one you aren't familiar with.

option 2: "Get All Cards"  This will print all of the saved cards onto the screen.  You'll then be able to choose which cards you would like to study simply by 
choosing the items number.

Upcoming Features:

1) I will be creating a version that will allow for a third column within the CSV so users can have the option to view a standard definition of the item instead
   of loading a webpage.
